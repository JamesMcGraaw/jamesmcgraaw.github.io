              The aim of this project was twofold: to design a database and populate it with data with at least 2 statics
              to on a theme, and to write an app in PHP that fetched that data from the database and displayed it on the page.
              There was an additional challenge of being able to update the database from the app, which I also completed.

                The aim of this project was to produce a web-based wordle-like game. The application was written in JavaScript.
                This was the first project we undertook as a group. In this project I worked on the styling of the letters
                after a guess had been made.

                The aim of this project was to make a job listing site in React, using Bootstrap to style the site to
                match a wireframe provided by the product owner. The site needed to fetch data from a pre-existing
                API and database and display the information on the page. I was the scrum master for this project, and
                as such kept abreast of what was happening throughout the project and acted as a liaison between the team
                and the Product owner.

                The aim of this project was to make an API to connect a pre-existing front end with a provided database. We had been
				studing OOP and this project was designed and executed to follow SOLID principles. The API needed to output the data 
				requested at a number of different endpoints in JSON format. I worked on the architecture of our file structure. I 
				also worked on the /artists endpoint to take all of the artists, their albums and the songs on each album from the 
				database to be displayed on the page.

                The aim of this project was to take some tasks from the backlog of an existing codebase and add new functionality/

				The project was written in PHP, JavaScript and HTML. I worked on adding buttons to allow students to edit their
				onboarding information and then save their inputted data to the database.
