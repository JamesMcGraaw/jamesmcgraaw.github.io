# Portfolio

Project for the first module done at iO Academy.
The brief was:

"You will build a personal website for showcasing your work.
You must design your site with a wireframe or wireframes - LucidChart, SketchPad, pen and paper, etc.
It should have:
An About section/page.
A Portfolio section/page containing:
An image (screenshot), title and description of each project.
A link to the live version and a link to the GitHub repo of the project.
A Contact section/page.
The page(s) of your website should be responsive.

The project was completed and reviewed by peers and trainers before being presented at the Sprint Review.
